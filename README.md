## Project Description

My project will collect the data of national parks scraped from a website and display corresponding visualized results based on usersâ€™ action on the Flask based website. 

On the homepage, the user could either search the detailed infomation of a particular park by the park name or start searching from the state. If the user choose to start from state, they will be navigated to a form, and then they can select a state name and submit the form to see a histogram indicating the number of different types of parks in that state. Then, they can select a type from that state, and a list of park name of that type in the state would be shown up. After that, the user could click the park name and the detailed park infomation would be displayed.
## How to run

1. Download the whole project
2. `cd` to the directory where ***requirements.txt*** is located
3. creat a new virtual environment, `python3 -m venv env` for python3 and `virtualenv env` for python2.
4. activate your virtual environment `source env/bin/activate`
5. insall required dependencies`pip install -r requirements.txt `
6. run `python SI507project.py runserver`
7. After finishing using the application, deactivate your virtual environment. `deactivate`

## How to use
This park would be implemented later after check in.

1. A useful instruction goes here
2. A useful second step here
3. (Optional): Markdown syntax to include an screenshot/image: ![alt text](image.jpg)

## Routes in this application
- `/` -> this is the home page
- `/stateForm` -> this route has a form for user to select state
- `/stateResult` -> this route is where the form sends the result.
- `/stateTypeResult/<state_name>/<type_name>` -> This route takes state name and type name as input and shows users a list of park name.
- `/park/<park_name>` -> this route takes input of a park name and shows users the detaild infomation of that park.

## How to run tests
1. First `cd` to the directory where ***SI507project_tests.py*** is located
2. Second run the test file `python SI507project_tests.py`
